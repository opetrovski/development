 * An application integrated with Catalog Manager may offer operations which

 * service operations can be used to access the resources of the 
 * application and perform administrative tasks without actually 
 * opening the application. 
 * </p>
 * <p> 
 * To provide for technical service operations, a Web service 
 * based on this API must be implemented. The operations
 * and the access information of the Web service must be 
 * specified in the technical service definition for the 
 * application. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The operations are invoked by users at runtime.
